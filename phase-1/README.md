# ðŸ’¡ Phase 1: Idea Submission & Initial Vetting  

## Submission  
An employee presents an idea to their manager or team. This can be:  
- **Informal** (e.g., a quick discussion)  
- **Formal** (e.g., a written proposal)  

## Early Discussions  
The team evaluates the idea based on three key factors:  
- **Problem** â€“ What issue does this idea solve?  
- **Target Audience** â€“ Who will benefit from this idea (e.g., customers, internal teams)?  
- **Business Strategy Alignment** â€“ Does the idea fit the companyâ€™s goals and priorities?  

## Business Value Validation  
At this stage, the focus is on whether the idea makes **business sense**:  
âœ” Will it generate revenue?  
âœ” Will it improve efficiency?  
âœ” Will it create value for users?  

## Minimal Technical Details  
The idea is assessed from a **high-level perspective**, without going deep into technical feasibility.  
- Engineering and development details come in later stages.  

---  
This phase ensures that only **valuable and relevant ideas** move forward, preventing wasted effort on ideas that donâ€™t align with business goals.
